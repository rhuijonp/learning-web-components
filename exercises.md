# Introduction to HTML Fundamentals
# Exercises

## Exercise 1

1. Save the above HTML in an empty text file.
1. Name the text file ["books.html"](books.html).
1. Open the text file in your browser.
1. Create a [screenshot](books_screenshot.jpg) of the results.


## Exercise 2

1. Visit codepen.io and create an account. Create a new pen, and create the base structure of a web page. Codepen is an excellent resource to have when learning, as you can quickly mockup ideas and test code as you learn. Codepen also automatically displays the results of _code linting_, which is where your code is checked for errors and warnings.
1. Copy the code below into a new HTML file. Remove the comment blocks around any element in the code. After “un-commenting” the elements inside of comment blocks, wrap a comment block around the element that contains sensitive data.

## Exercise 3

1. Create a new HTML document using your computer's text editor by opening a new text file and saving it with the ".html" extension. Create one or two files, until you know you can create other HTML files on demand.

	[example 1](file1.html)
	[example 2](file2.html)
	[example 3](file3.html)

1. Inside of a new [HTML file](exercise3b.html), add at least 2 of each element discussed in this section. You will effectively develop an intimacy with HTML by testing the language out. At the bottom of your HTML document, underneath all of your "tests," write a paragraph about places on the web where you've seen or used the elements you learned in this section. Then, write a short paragraph (1-3 sentences) on the role–how and why that HTML tag was used–on another website. A few examples of roles are:

- To navigate the site
- List information
- Draw attention to special information
- Create a linked image
